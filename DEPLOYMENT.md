# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Start (Non-Interactive)

### 1. Deploy to Railway

**Option A: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Push to your repository (Railway auto-deploys)
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Railway"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project: `appealing-wisdom`
3. Select service: `tally-sync-vyaapari360`
4. Click "Deploy" button

**Option C: Railway CLI (Non-Interactive)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy with timeout (prevents hanging)
timeout 60s railway up || echo "Deploy completed or timed out"
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Set variables in one command (non-interactive)
railway variables --set "TALLY_URL=https://e34014bc0666.ngrok-free.app" --set "NODE_ENV=production" --skip-deploys

# Verify variables
railway variables --json | jq '.data[] | select(.key == "TALLY_URL" or .key == "NODE_ENV")'
```

### 3. Get Your API URL

```bash
# Get the deployment URL (non-interactive)
railway status --json | jq -r '.data.publicDomain'

# Or use the known URL
echo "https://tally-sync-vyaapari360-production.up.railway.app"
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployment

### Automated Testing (Recommended)

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
./test-railway-deployment.sh

# Quick health check
./monitor-api.sh check
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test Health Endpoint
curl -s "https://tally-sync-vyaapari360-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/health" | jq

# Test Sync from Tally
curl -X POST "https://tally-sync-vyaapari360-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/sync/SKM/MAIN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fromDate": "20250901", "toDate": "20250930"}' | jq

# Test Get Vouchers
curl -s "https://tally-sync-vyaapari360-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/vouchers/SKM/MAIN" | jq
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your Deployment

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# Start monitoring (runs continuously)
./monitor-api.sh monitor

# Quick health check
./monitor-api.sh check

# View recent logs
./monitor-api.sh logs
```

### Railway Dashboard Monitoring

1. **Logs**: https://railway.app/dashboard â†’ Select Project â†’ Select Service â†’ Logs
2. **Metrics**: https://railway.app/dashboard â†’ Select Project â†’ Select Service â†’ Metrics
3. **Environment Variables**: https://railway.app/dashboard â†’ Select Project â†’ Select Service â†’ Variables

## ðŸ”— Lovable.dev Integration

### 1. Update API Base URL

In your Lovable.dev project, update the API base URL:

```javascript
const TALLY_API_BASE = 'https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/v1';
```

### 2. Use the Integration Code

Copy the `lovable-integration.js` file to your Lovable.dev project and use the components:

```javascript
import { TallyAPIService, useTallyVouchers, TallyVoucherManager } from './lovable-integration';

// Use in your components
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TallyVoucherManager companyId="SKM" divisionId="MAIN" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## ðŸ“Š API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/health` | System health check |
| POST | `/api/v1/sync/{companyId}/{divisionId}` | Sync data from Tally |
| GET | `/api/v1/vouchers/{companyId}/{divisionId}` | List vouchers with filtering |
| GET | `/api/v1/voucher/{companyId}/{divisionId}/{voucherId}` | Get single voucher |
| PUT | `/api/v1/voucher/{companyId}/{divisionId}/{voucherId}` | Update voucher |
| GET | `/api/v1/voucher/{companyId}/{divisionId}/{voucherId}/xml` | Export as Tally XML |

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`
- `PORT`: Railway will set this automatically
- `TALLY_URL`: Your ngrok URL for Tally server

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

### View Logs

```bash
railway logs
```

### Check Status

```bash
railway status
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tally URL not working**: Make sure your ngrok URL is active
2. **Sync fails**: Check Tally server is running and accessible
3. **API not responding**: Check Railway logs for errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View recent logs
railway logs --tail

# Check environment variables
railway variables
```
