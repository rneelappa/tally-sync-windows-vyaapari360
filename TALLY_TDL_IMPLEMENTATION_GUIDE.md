# Tally TDL Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The issue with our Tally integration is that **standard Tally reports ignore external date parameters** and default to the current accounting period. This is why we get the same 12 vouchers regardless of whether we request June 2025 or September 2025.

## 🔧 Solution: Custom TDL Report with Proper Date Filtering

### Step 1: Load the Custom TDL Report into Tally

1. **Save the TDL File**: The file `VyaapariDateFilteredReport.tdl` contains our custom report definition
2. **Open Tally Prime**: Navigate to your Tally installation
3. **Access TDL Management**: 
   - Press `F1` (Help) → `TDL & Add-On`
   - Or use `Ctrl+Alt+T` from anywhere in Tally
4. **Load the TDL File**:
   - Select "Manage Local TDLs" (F4)
   - Set "Load selected TDL files on startup" to `Yes`
   - In "File Name", specify the full path to `VyaapariDateFilteredReport.tdl`
   - Press `Ctrl+A` to save and reload

### Step 2: Verify TDL Loading

1. Check the TDL management screen for any red flags or errors
2. The report `VyaapariDateFilteredReport` should now be available in Tally's memory
3. You can test it manually in Tally by going to Reports and looking for the custom report

### Step 3: Updated API Usage

Once the TDL is loaded, our API will use the custom report instead of the standard DayBook:

```xml
<ENVELOPE>
  <HEADER>
    <ID>VyaapariDateFilteredReport</ID>
  </HEADER>
  <BODY>
    <DESC>
      <STATICVARIABLES>
        <SVFROMDATE>20250601</SVFROMDATE>
        <SVTODATE>20250630</SVTODATE>
      </STATICVARIABLES>
    </DESC>
  </BODY>
</ENVELOPE>
```

## 🎯 Key Features of Our Custom TDL

### Proper Date Filtering
```tdl
[System: VyaapariDateFilter]
  Type: Formulae
  Formula: NOT $IsCancelled AND NOT $IsOptional AND $$IsGTE:$Date:##SVFROMDATE AND $$IsLTE:$Date:##SVTODATE
```

This filter ensures that:
- `$$IsGTE:$Date:##SVFROMDATE` - Voucher date >= Start date
- `$$IsLTE:$Date:##SVTODATE` - Voucher date <= End date
- `NOT $IsCancelled` - Excludes cancelled vouchers
- `NOT $IsOptional` - Excludes optional vouchers

### Comprehensive Data Fetching
```tdl
[Collection: VyaapariVoucherCollection]
  Fetch: Guid, Date, VoucherTypeName, VoucherNumber, Reference, ReferenceDate, Narration, PartyLedgerName, PlaceOfSupply, IsInvoice, IsAccounting, IsInventory, IsCancelled, IsOptional, Amount
```

This ensures all necessary voucher data is retrieved efficiently.

## 📊 Expected Results

After implementing this solution:

1. **June 2025 requests** will return vouchers specifically from June 2025
2. **September 2025 requests** will return vouchers specifically from September 2025
3. **Date filtering will work correctly** instead of defaulting to current period
4. **We should see different voucher counts** for different months

## 🔍 Testing the Solution

### Before TDL Implementation:
- June 2025: 12 vouchers (same as September)
- September 2025: 12 vouchers (same as June)
- **Issue**: Same data regardless of date range

### After TDL Implementation:
- June 2025: Should return actual June vouchers
- September 2025: Should return actual September vouchers
- **Result**: Different data based on actual date ranges

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **TDL Must Be Loaded**: The custom TDL report must be loaded into Tally's memory before API calls
2. **Report Name Must Match**: The `<ID>VyaapariDateFilteredReport</ID>` must match the TDL report name exactly
3. **Date Format**: Dates must be in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20250601`)
4. **Case Sensitive**: TDL is extremely case-sensitive - use exact naming

## 🔄 Fallback Strategy

If the custom TDL fails to load or work:
1. The API will return an "Invalid object error" (which we've seen before)
2. We can fall back to the standard DayBook report
3. We can implement client-side date filtering as a temporary workaround

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create custom TDL report with proper date filtering
- [x] Update server.js to use custom report ID
- [ ] Load TDL file into Tally Prime
- [ ] Test with different date ranges
- [ ] Verify different voucher counts for different periods
- [ ] Deploy and validate the solution

This implementation addresses the **root cause** of the date filtering issue and should provide accurate, date-specific voucher retrieval.
